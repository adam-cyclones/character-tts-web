## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Rust 1.70+ and Cargo
- Internet connection (for downloading voice models)

### Build from Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pitch-tts.git
cd pitch-tts

# Build the release version
cargo build --release

# The binary will be available at target/release/pitch-tts
```

### First Run
On first run, pitch-tts will automatically download the default voice model (en_GB-alba-medium). Voice models are cached in the `models/` directory.

## üìñ Usage

### List Available Voices
```bash
# List all voices
cargo run -- list

# Group voices by language
cargo run -- list --by-language
```

### Speak Text
```bash
# Use defaults (Scottish Alba voice with fun phrase)
cargo run -- say

# Custom text with default voice
cargo run -- say "Hello, world!"

# Custom voice and text
cargo run -- say "Bonjour!" --voice fr_FR-gilles-low

# With pitch shifting (1.5x = higher pitch)
cargo run -- say "High pitched voice" --pitch 1.5

# With pitch preset (helium, child, deep, slomo)
cargo run -- say "Helium voice!" --pitch helium
cargo run -- say "Child voice!" --pitch child
cargo run -- say "Deep voice!" --pitch deep
cargo run -- say "Slow motion!" --pitch slomo

# Combine all options
cargo run -- say "Custom message" --voice en_US-amy-medium --pitch 0.8
```

### Export to WAV
```bash
# Export with default settings
cargo run -- export --voice en_GB-alba-medium --output hello.wav --text "Hello world!"

# Export with pitch shifting
cargo run -- export --voice en_US-libritts_r-medium --output high_pitch.wav --text "High pitched audio" --pitch 1.3

# Export for Blender integration
cargo run -- export --voice en_GB-alan-medium --output character_speech.wav --text "Character dialogue here" --pitch 1.0
```

### Legacy Mode (Quick Commands)
```bash
# Direct voice and text specification (legacy behavior)
cargo run -- --voice en_US-libritts_r-medium --text "Quick mode!"
```

## üéµ Voice Examples

### English Voices
- **Scottish**: `en_GB-alba-medium` - Charming Scottish accent
- **British**: `en_GB-alan-medium` - Clear British English
- **US Male**: `en_US-ryan-medium` - Natural American male voice
- **US Female**: `en_US-amy-medium` - Clear American female voice

### International Voices
- **German**: `de_DE-thorsten-medium` - Natural German male voice
- **French**: `fr_FR-gilles-low` - French male voice
- **Spanish**: `es_ES-carlfm-x_low` - Spanish male voice
- **Italian**: `it_IT-riccardo-x_low` - Italian male voice
- **Russian**: `ru_RU-denis-medium` - Russian male voice

## üìö Library Usage

Use `pitch_tts` as a Rust library for custom TTS workflows:

```rust
use pitch_tts::{synth_with_voice_config, pitch_shift, synth_to_wav_with_pitch};

// Synthesize speech
let samples = synth_with_voice_config(
    "Hello from the library!".to_string(), 
    "en_GB-alba-medium"
)?;

// Apply pitch shifting
let shifted_samples = pitch_shift(&samples, 1.2);

// Export to WAV
synth_to_wav_with_pitch(
    "Library test".to_string(),
    "en_US-amy-medium",
    "output.wav",
    0.9
)?;
```

## üß™ Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests (configured for single-threaded execution to prevent audio conflicts)
cargo test

# Run specific test file
cargo test --test cli_tests

# Run specific test
cargo test test_cli_say_output_validation

# Run with single thread (recommended for audio tests)
cargo test -- --test-threads=1
```

**Note**: Tests are configured to run single-threaded in `Cargo.toml` to prevent audio conflicts when multiple CLI tests play audio simultaneously.

### Test Categories
- **CLI Functionality**: Tests all command-line interface features
- **Audio Playback**: Validates actual audio synthesis and playback
- **Voice Management**: Tests voice listing and selection
- **Pitch Shifting**: Verifies pitch modification functionality
- **WAV Export**: Tests file export capabilities

## üéØ Use Cases

### Content Creation
- Generate voice-overs for videos and podcasts
- Create character voices for games and animations
- Produce multilingual content with consistent quality

### Development & Testing
- Test audio applications and interfaces
- Generate sample audio for machine learning projects
- Create automated voice prompts for applications

### Blender Integration
- Export WAV files for lip-sync animation
- Generate character dialogue for 3D animations
- Create voice tracks for video projects

## üîß Configuration

### Voice Model Storage
Voice models are automatically downloaded and stored in the `models/` directory:
```
models/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en_GB-alba-medium.onnx
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en_GB-alba-medium.onnx.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ en_US-amy-medium.onnx
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Pitch Shifting
- **Range**: 0.5x to 2.0x (octave down to octave up)
- **Default**: 1.0x (no change)
- **Algorithm**: Linear interpolation resampling
- **Presets**:
  - `slomo`: 0.7 (slow motion)
  - `deep`: 0.85 (deeper voice)
  - `child`: 1.1 (child-like voice)
  - `helium`: 1.5 (chipmunk/helium effect)
